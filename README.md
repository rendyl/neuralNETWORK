Gamagora 2019 - AI - Neural Network

*Neural Network C++ made FromScratch*

**Actual Features :**
- XOR Training
> Testing for XOR is done with all possibilities
- Text Language Recognition (TLR) Training
  - English
  - French
  - Spanish
  - Italian
  - Dutch
> Testing for TLR is done with a French and an English text

**How does it work ?**
- User chooses between testing XOR or TLR
- User chooses how many Training displays he wants to see
- **Network Creation**
- **Network Training**
- **Network Testing**

**Architecture :**
- Training Files are in Data/Training/
- Testing Files are in Data/Testing/
